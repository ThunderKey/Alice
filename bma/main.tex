\chapter{Artificial Intelligence}
\section{What is AI?}

This question has about as many answers as there are people studying artificial intelligence. Without getting too philosophical one could say that intelligence is defined by the efficiency of patterns used to solve problems in a complex environment and the ability to learn or generate new patterns by observing or testing.

Man-made programs to solve such problems have been around for decades and as algorithm efficiency and computational power increases they get ever more powerful.

An AI usually is directed towards one goal. This could mean solving a mathematical challenge most efficiently, finding patterns in huge amounts of data to categorize new sets of data or even to find smarter ways of learning.

\subsection{Amazone Recommandations}
Everyone knows the ``People who bought X also bought Y''-kind of recommandations online shops provide you with. Sometimes they are on the spot and other times they are as far off as they can be. The idea of course is to find patterns in customer interest which can be used to offer people things they are likely to buy.
