\section*{What is AI?}

This question has about as many answers as there are people studying artificial intelligence. Without getting too philosophical one could say that intelligence is defined by the efficiency of patterns used to solve problems in a complex environment and the ability to learn or generate new patterns by observing or testing.

Man-made programs to solve such problems have been around for decades and as algorithm efficiency and computational power increases they get ever more powerful.

An AI usually is directed towards one goal. This could mean solving a mathematical challenge most efficiently, finding patterns in huge amounts of data to categorize new sets of data or even to find smarter ways of learning.


\section*{History of the Field}

\section*{Real World Examples}

\subsection*{Amazone Recommandations}
Everyone knows the ``People who bought X also bought Y''-kind of recommandations online shops provide you with. Sometimes they are on the spot and other times they are as far off as they can be. The idea of course is to find patterns in customer interest which can be used to offer people things they are likely to buy.

\section*{Physics Engine}
A physics engine is able to recreate an entire physical system like our world. The gravity is the biggest part to cover. There are less and more accurate engines. In some the falling objects get faster or the objects can break when the fall on a solid ground.
\subsection*{Gravity Example}
A block gets thrown horizontally with the force F. This block has now the force from the throw (horizontally) and from the gravity (vertically).
\subsection*{Collision Example}
This scenario is without gravity. A block gets thrown horizontally with the force F and collides with another, steady one with the same size and weight. After the collision the first block will fly back with half the force, while the other one gets pushed away with the other half of the force.

But let's not go any further in this topic. Even though it is a really interesting topic, it is too extensive to go into the details.
The physics engines are mostly common in animated films and video games. 

For that would take too much time to create an own physics engine, we decided to use the open source engine Crafty.
