Alice
=====

This paper has the audacious goal to provide the reader with a new perspective on the vast and ever-growing field of artificial intelligence. It talks about different types of AI, it shows where they are used right now and it goes into detail on how we implemented a very basic AI to solve a jump and run game. 
Yet this document aims to be more than just a fun example of a computer playing a game. We will show how artificial learning processes work and how they compare to what we know about human learning behavior.
 
Ultimately it is nearly impossible to write a paper about AI and ignore the fundamental implications it has on our understanding of intelligence and consciousness. Which is why we will try to provide some insight into the philosophical question the field of AI raises.
